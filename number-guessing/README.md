## guess-the-number-in-python
Simple guess the number game made in python. Guess a number between 1 and 20. 
This little program is being used to get myself familiar with Git and Github again.

Used some input validation, implement guess ranges.

Might DO: Might let users chose the range where they'll like the random number to come from, as well as how many guesses they'll like.
